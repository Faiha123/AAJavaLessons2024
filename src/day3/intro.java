	//platform--> means operating systems (windows, mac, linux)
	//Object oriented--> means there should be classes those contains objects, should support inheritance concept
	       //it should support data abstraction
	       //it should support encapsulation
	       //Polymorphism
	
	
	//Types of programming Languages-->
	//1)STRUCTURED: C, python
	//2)Object Based: VB, VBscript, python .. (Don't support polymorphism & inheritance)
	//3)Object Oriented: C++, JAVA, C#, python
