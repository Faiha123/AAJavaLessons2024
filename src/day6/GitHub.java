	//You'll have a laptop.
	//end of the day you'll have created 5-6 classes that includes methods
	//you work on station1, other QA on station2, other on station3 on the same project
	//end of the day you guys push your created code and merge together in the Framework.
	//Framework is set of rules and guidelines you all have to follow the same rules.
	//VCS is the place where you send those codes.
	//in programming it is very important to track the codes.
	//Widely used version control system is GIT. it works on your local machine. you save your code in local repo first.
	//in GIT you'd be able to see the changes you made.  with every single commit. 
	//in GIT every single commit is a reference number.
	//but you need to put those codes somewhere.
	//this is where comes GitHub, which is Remote Repository. all of you send your codes to this cloud.
	//It is also widely used.
	//scope of creating branches in remote repository
	//someone(lead) will look to these codes and accepts the merge request and send them to master branch.
	//Master Branch should have bug free codes.
	//Sometimes you'll have merge conflict. after fixing then merges into master.
	//Next morning when you come to office you pull the codes from the master branch where you'll have the modified codes.
	//This cycle would continue.

	//3)Git Repository: Once you commit the code to git repository it WILL stay in your workspace. Git Repository gets a copy of Your actual work
	//4)Remote Repository: 
	//We have downloaded Git. now you need to Git know who we are.
	//You need to create a local Git repository
